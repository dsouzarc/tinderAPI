##A Tinder Bot - under construction

Analyzes the facial components of people you swipe for on Tinder.

Uses OpenCV for facial recognition and identification of facial characteristics - some information still needs to be filled out manually though.

Uses Google's TensorFlow library for machine learning in determining the characteristics the user looks for.

Uses PyQt for the GUI and Tinder's (unofficial) REST API. Swipe information is stored in a file to be processed.

Though it is a boring/plain GUI, its main task is to train the neural net to on what the user likes
