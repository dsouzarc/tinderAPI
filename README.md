##A Tinder Bot - under construction

Uses a neural network to figure out what you look for in a person (or what you don't look for - still under debate on which is more accurate) and performs those actions on Tinder.

As of now, it's only a GUI that uses a Tinder API client I wrote to display a person's pictures and information from Tinder.
Multiple pictures for that person can be viewed and facial recognition is performed on each image.

The swipe information is stored to a file to be processed.

Though it is a boring/plain GUI, its main task is to train the neural net to on what the user likes
